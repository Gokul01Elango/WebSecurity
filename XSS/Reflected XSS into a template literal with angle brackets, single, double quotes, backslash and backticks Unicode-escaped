In this input field the developer sanitize all type of input fields
The backticks are symbol used in the programing actual simple is `` 
The characters and literals are encoded using various techniques . so direct character or symbols input is not works
so another method is :  
                name = 'gokul';
                alert("hello ${name}";
                output is :   in the popup window hello gokul will be display
For this lab : 
                var message = `0 search results for '${alert(111)}'`;
  instead of any value or text you may enter script content.
